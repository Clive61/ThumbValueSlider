# ThumbValueSlider
Example of custom SwiftUI slider

This code was written because I wanted to display the value of the slider in the thumb. It’s also a example off writing a customer slider.

I started writing this because I wanted it in my own application. But  I also came across an YouTube video by Jay Wardell (Double-headed Slider in SwiftUI). So some of this is mine and some I got from Jay’s video. 

Please feel free to use this code.
